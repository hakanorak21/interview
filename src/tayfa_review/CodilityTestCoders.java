17. Write a function:
that, given a positive integer N, prints the consecutive numbers from 1 to
N, each on a separate line. However, any number divisible by 2, 3 or 5
should be replaced by the word Codility, Test or Coders respectively. If a
number is divisible by more than one of the numbers: 2,3 or 5, it should be
replaced by a concatenation of the respective words Codility, Test and
Coders in this given order. For example, numbers divisible by both 2 and 3
should be replaced by CodilityTest and numbers divisible by all
three numbers: 2,3 and 5, should be replaced by CodilityTestCoders.
