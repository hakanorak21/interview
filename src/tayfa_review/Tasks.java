/*
1. Write a return method that check if a string is build out of the same
letters as another string.
Ex: same("abc", "cab"); -> true , same("abc", "abb"); -> false:

2. Write a return method that can remove the duplicated values
from String
Ex: removeDup("AAABBBCCC") ==> ABC

3. Write a return method that can find the unique characters from the
String
Ex: unique("AAABBBCCCDEF") ==> "DEF";

4. Write a return method that can reverse String
Ex: Reverse("ABCD"); ==> DCBA

5. Write a return method that can find the frequency of
characters
Ex: FrequencyOfChars("AAABBCDD") ==> A3B2C1D2

6. Write a return method that can verify if a password is valid or not.
requirements:
1. Password MUST be at least have 6 characters and should not contain space
2. PassWord should at least contain one upper case letter
3. PassWord should at least contain one lowercase letter
4. Password should at least contain one special characters
5. Password should at least contain a digit
if all requirements above are met, the method returns true, otherwise
returns false

7. Write a method that can find the maximum number from an int
Array

8. Write a method that can find the minimum number from an int
Array

9. Write a return method that can sort an int array in Ascending
order without using the sort method of the Arrays class
Ex:
int[] arr = {10, 9, 8, 7};
arr = Sort(arr); ==>{ 7, 8, 9, 10};

10. Write a return method that can sort an int array in descending order
without using the sort method of the Arrays class
Ex: int[] arr = {10,20,7, 8, 90};
arr = Sort(arr); ==> {90, 20, 10, 8, 7};

11. Write a function that, given an integer N (1 < N < 100), 
returns an array containing N unique integers that sum up to 0. 
The function can return any such array. For example, given N = 4, 
the function could return [1,0, -3,2] or [-2,1, -4,5]. 
The answer [1, -1,1,3] would be incorrect (because value 1 occurs twice). 
For N = 3 one of the possible answers is [-1,0,1] 
(but there are many more correct answers).

12. Given an array of 3 characters print all permutation
combinations from the given characters

13. Write a method which can identifies given number is even or
odd

14. Write a method that can divide two numbers without using
division operator

15. Write a method which prints out the numbers from 1 to 30 but
for numbers which are a multiple of 3, print "FIN" instead of the
number and for numbers which are a multiple of 5, print "RA" instead
of the number. for numbers which are a multiple of both 3 and 5, print
"FINRA" instead of the number.

16. Swap two variable' values without using a third variable

17. Write a function:
that, given a positive integer N, prints the consecutive numbers from 1 to
N, each on a separate line. However, any number divisible by 2, 3 or 5
should be replaced by the word Codility, Test or Coders respectively. If a
number is divisible by more than one of the numbers: 2,3 or 5, it should be
replaced by a concatenation of the respective words Codility, Test and
Coders in this given order. For example, numbers divisible by both 2 and 3
should be replacÃ©e by CodilityTest and numbers divisible by all
three numbers: 2,3 and 5, should be replaced by CodilityTestCoders.

18. Given a list of people' names: "Ahmed", "John", Eric",
"Ahmed".....
Write a java operation to remove all the names named Ahmed

19. Given a list of Integers 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 ....etc. remove all values
greater than 100.

(same as 12)
20. Given an array of 3 characters print all permutation
combinations from the given characters
